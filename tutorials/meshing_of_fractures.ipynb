    "A critical concept in meshing of fractured domains is the concept of geometric tolerance: Since we are operating in finite precision aritmethics, two points may or may not be consider equal (or similarly, two lines / planes may or may not intersect), depending on how accurately we consider their representation. At least three concepts come into play here\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The accuracy of the numerical representation of the objects (accumulated effect of finite precision rounding errors).\n",
    "2. The accuracy in geological interpretation of fracture data: If the fracture network originates from an interpretation of satellite images, differences measured in centimeters should be treated with some caution\n",
    "3. The resolution of the computational grid: If points with a certain distance are considered non-equal, this may also require that we resolve their difference in the mesh. In addition, the mesh generator will use its own concept of geometric tolerance for internal calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PorePy, these issues are attempted resolved as follows: The `FractureNetwork` has an attribute `tol` that represent the geometric tolerance used in the calculation of intersections and subsequent splitting of the fractures. If meshing is done with gmsh, the tolerances used in PorePy and gmsh are related. The approach works reasonably well, but for complex configurations of fracture intersections, stability issues can arise. We are working to improve these matters."
